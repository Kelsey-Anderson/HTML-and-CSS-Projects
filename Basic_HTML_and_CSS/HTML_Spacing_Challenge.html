<section>
<p><span style="color:red;font-weight:bold">Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.<br>
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
And summer’s lease hath all too short a date.</span><br>

<p><span style="color:purple;font-weight:bold">Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;<br>
And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
By chance, or nature’s changing course, untrimmed;</span><br>
</section>
</p>
<section>
<p><span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st,<br>
Nor shall death brag thou wand’rest in his shade,<br>
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow’st.</span><br>

<p><span style="color:green;font-weight:bold">So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br>
So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</span><br>
